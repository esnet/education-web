            <strong>What is a Security Engineer?</strong>
            <br>
            In today's digital age, the role of a security engineer is more crucial than ever. A security engineer is a professional who protects an organization's computer systems, networks, and data from potential threats and breaches. They design and implement security measures to safeguard sensitive information and ensure that cybersecurity protocols are up to date. This role is essential in preventing cyber-attacks, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining privacy.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The Obstacles Security Engineers Face</strong>
            <br>
            Security engineers encounter several challenges in their line of work. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, requiring engineers to stay ahead of hackers and cybercriminals. They must continuously update their knowledge and skills to combat new vulnerabilities and exploit techniques. Additionally, security engineers often work under high pressure, especially during a security breach or threat. Balancing the need for robust security with the ease of system usability can also be a tricky obstacle to navigate.
